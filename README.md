Serverside aspects from CryptPad.
Whatever's required to get a server running, and in theory nothing more.

## installation

I assume you have a fairly recent version of nodejs.

If not install with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Install dependencies with `npm i`, then launch the server with `npm start`.
